# Analysis on Synthetic Alzheimers MRIs   
### For the Biolib Synthetic Health Data hackathon 2020  

The Alzheimers challenge provided the participants with:  
An imbalanced dataset of Real Alzheimers MRIs and  
A balanced dataset of Synthetic Alzheimers MRIs generated by cGANs    


### We analyzed the impact of Alzheimers disease on the real and synthetic dataset:

### We compared the dataset distributions:

### After analyzing and training on the ensamble dataset we applied Grad-Cam algorithm:  
Showing the activations of early convolutional (Alexnet) layers for a moderate Alzheimers case:
